# WeatherAPIhw

This project was to code out a web page that displays current weather info about a searched city and a 5 day forecast as well.

How it works

The page opens with a search area to the left under a large header where the user can input the city they want to get weather info on. After the text field is filled there is a search button that will need to be pressed to ping the API for the current; Temp(F), Humidity, Wind Speed, UV Index and a 5-day forecast. It will then display this information in a large information container to the right with the forecast being displayed in boxes under the current weather info. Then the searched city will be saved under the search bar with the most recent searched at the top. If the user searches a new city the previous info from the last search will be cleared and replaced with the new cities current weather and forecast. When the page is revisted previously searched cities will be available under the search bar and the last searched cities forecast will still be present as well.
